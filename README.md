# Food Recognition System (Soft Computing Project)

This project implements a deep learning–based food image classification system using **InceptionV3**. It was developed as part of a soft computing course to demonstrate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in real-world computer vision tasks.

---

## Objective

The goal of this system is to classify food images into **101 categories** using a transfer learning approach. The model is trained to recognize different types of food based on image data, utilizing modern deep learning techniques like fine-tuning, data augmentation, and regularization.

##  Features & Workflow

###  Dataset Splitting

- Total images:
  - **80,800 training**
  - **10,100 validation**
  - **10,100 test**
- All images are evenly distributed across 101 classes.
- Splitting logic is handled in `splitting_rule.ipynb`.

###  Preprocessing & Augmentation

- Preprocessing done using `ImageDataGenerator`:
  - Rescale
  - Rotation
  - Zoom
  - Width & height shift
  - Horizontal flip
- Applied only to the training dataset to prevent overfitting.

###  Overfitting Control

The following techniques are used to minimize overfitting:

- **Dropout(0.5)** in the dense layer
- **EarlyStopping**: Stops training when validation loss plateaus
- **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best model during training
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces learning rate if validation loss stops improving

## Evaluation Metrics

- Training & Validation **Accuracy** and **Loss**
- **Training time per epoch**
- **Final model size**
- Test accuracy on unseen data

##  Running the Project
 Dataset is not included in the GitHub repository due to its size (~10GB). You must download it manually.

Place your dataset like this:

```bash
food-recognition-system/
└── dataset/
    ├── train/
    ├── val/
    └── test/
```
Then run the training notebook: 
```bash
jupyter notebook train.ipynb
```

##  Pretrained Model File
Due to GitHub’s file size limit, the final trained model (model.keras) is not stored in this repo.
